Version numbering
-----------------

UProC uses `semantic versioning`_. This means that the version number has the
format ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` and an increment in one of the parts has the
following meaning:

1. ``MAJOR``: The user interface (input, output and/or command-line arguments)
   of the programs or the format of the supplementary files was changed in a
   backwards-incompatible manner.
2. ``MINOR``: Some functionality was added.
3. ``PATCH``: One or more bugs were fixed.

If ``MINOR`` or ``PATCH`` are incremented, all modifications are
backwards-compatible. See the `semantic versioning`_ homepage for details.

.. _`semantic versioning`: http://semver.org


License
-------

The code for the UProC executables is available under the GNU GPL (see the
``COPYING`` file). However, most of the functionality is separated into a
library called ``libuproc``, using the GNU LGPL (see the ``COPYING.LESSER``
file). By default, the executables are built statically, you have to pass
``--enable-shared`` to the configure script if you want to build ``libuproc``
as a shared library (see the `Installation from source`_ section below).


============
Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

UProC uses the `GNU Autotools`_, so installation should work on any system that
has a POSIX compatible ``/bin/sh``, ``make`` and a C99 compiler.

For additional features, UProC has the following **optional** dependencies:

zlib
    On-the-fly ``gzip`` (de-)compression of files. This is probably already
    installed on your computer, but you need to make sure that the development
    headers are also available.

OpenMP
    UProC uses OpenMP for parallelization, if the compiler suports it. The
    configure script automatically detects whether this is the case.


.. _`GNU Autotools`: http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual


Installation from source
------------------------

To install UProC from a source tarball, simply extract it and run the
commands::

        ./configure
        make
        make install

By default, the executables are built in a way that you can omit the ``make
install`` step and just run them from wherever you wish.

You can pass the following options (and more) to the ``configure`` script:

--prefix=PREFIX     Install all files below ``PREFIX`` (see the ``INSTALL``
                    file for details).

--disable-openmp    Do not use OpenMP (i.e. disable multi-threading). This will
                    usually cause longer running times. You probably don't want
                    this.

--enable-shared     Build and install ``libuproc`` as shared library. This will
                    also install the header files and, if ``doxygen`` is
                    installed, API reference.


See the ``INSTALL`` file for a more detailed generic description of the
installation process.


===================
Supplementary files
===================

UProC needs certain files at runtime. These files are split into two
categories, usually available as two distinct directories in the file system.


Database
--------

The database consists of files representing a set of known protein subsequences
that map to given families, e.g. extracted from PFAM.

There are two ways to obtain a database:

1.  You can download a database from http://no-url-yet and import it with the
    `uproc-import` program.
2.  Alternatively, you can create your own database with the `uproc-makedb`
    program.

Detailed instructions for these programs can be found by passing the `-h`
option when running them.


Model
-----

The model consists of files containing certain parameters that are not tied to
a particular database. You can download the newest model files from
http://no-url-yet.


=============
Running UProC
=============

UProC consists of the following command-line programs:

``uproc-prot``
    Protein sequence classifier.

``uproc-dna``
    DNA/RNA sequence classifier.

``uproc-orf``
    Command-line interface to the ORF translation mechanism used by
    ``uproc-dna``.

``uproc-import``
    Import database.

``uproc-export``
    Export database.

``uproc-makedb``
    Create a new database.

You can pass the ``-h`` argument to find out how they are used.
